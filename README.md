# üëã Hello World! I'm Stephen Lewis 
## About Me 
  I started coding in 2023 through [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/), where I spent almost a year gaining experience with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. That foundation gave me a deep respect for backend logic ‚Äî and for the struggle of learning something totally new.

I just wrapped up my Intro to Programming course with [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/), and I‚Äôm gearing up for the next phase‚Äîdiving into React and pushing towards full-stack development.  My latest project? A front-end portfolio powered by an open Marvel API. Proud of that one.

Most evenings, you‚Äôll find me working as a Line Cook at [Mill Creek Tavern](http://themillcreektavern.com)‚Äîcooking up plates by night, and code by (late) night. When the kitchen closes, the laptop opens.  During the day, I study, read, and (more often than not) find myself in Slack or Discord helping newer students.  We‚Äôve all had to stare down that imposter syndrome. Nobody gets here by accident. I like showing folks how to problem-solve, check the docs, research, and own their place at the table.

Along the way, I‚Äôve made a lot of network connections‚Äîlet‚Äôs be real, friends üòâ‚Äîand it‚Äôs wild to see how fast this community can grow when we help each other level up.
The evening class sessions, open chats, and ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs welcome‚Äù vibe have made learning here actually fun. Tech isn‚Äôt just a job to me‚Äîit‚Äôs a personal mission.
If you ever see me in a tutoring session, odds are you‚Äôll catch some code, a little laughter, and a reminder that building cool things together is what this era is all about.






Now, I‚Äôm continuing my education with , where I will be learning **React** and sharpening my frontend skills to complete the full stack.

By day, I work full-time as a Line Cook at **Mill Creek Tavern**. By night, I study, build, and help mentor others. I run casual tutoring sessions for newer students to help them push past imposter syndrome ‚Äî something we all know too well. Teaching helps me stay sharp and give back at the same time.

This isn't just a career path ‚Äî it's a personal mission. I'm here to learn, build, and to help open the door for other in underprivileged communities into tech.
